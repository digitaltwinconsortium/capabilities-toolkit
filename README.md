# Digital Twin Consortium Capabilities ToolKit

Public repository for DTC Digital Twin Capabilities Toolkit and AI Agent Capabilities Periodic Table.

The Digital Twin Capabilities Periodic Table (CPT) is an architecture and technology-agnostic requirements definition
framework for digital engineering projects. It is aimed at organizations who want to design, develop, deploy and operate
digital twins based on use case capability requirements versus the features of technology solutions.

The CPT is a cornerstone of our work, reflecting digital engineering methodologies and leading practices, such as
model-based systems engineering and advances in AI, and adapts over time as complexity increases. The ongoing iterations
of CPT reflect our commitment to continuous improvement, driven by our community's valuable insights and active
participation.

The CPT framework facilitates collaboration for teams that need to create digital twin requirements specifications in
large-scale, complex environments. The framework keeps the focus on the capability requirements of individual use cases.
These use cases can then be aggregated to determine the overall capability requirements, the digital twin platforms, and
other technology solutions that are required to address the specific business needs.

The CPT follows a periodic table approach with capabilities grouped or "clustered" around common characteristics. It is
easy to interpret at both the boardroom when explaining the business case to get funding for a Digital Twin project, and
the shopfloor when gathering requirements for a Digital Twin application. It provides visual guidance for collaboration,
brainstorming and making capability requirements explicit.

This initiative:

- Provides a foundation for an emerging marketplace
- Enables development teams to collaborate, design, and build
- Accelerates digital twin adoption
- Access all Digital Twin Capabilities Periodic Table elements, including the Digital Twin CPT, User Guide, Toolkit,
  Worksheet, and "What's New" documents.
