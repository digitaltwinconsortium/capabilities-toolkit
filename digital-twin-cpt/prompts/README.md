# Digital Twin CPT Prompts and Sequences

This folder contains prompt engineering resources and sequence templates for the Digital Twin Capabilities Periodic Table framework. These resources help users systematically approach capability assessment, and implementation planning.

## Folder Contents

### Digital Twin Sequence Prompts (`digitaltwin_sequence_prompts/`)
Specialized prompts for DT CPT workflow and capability analysis:
- **`step_0_use_case_suitability.md`** - Initial assessment prompt for evaluating whether a specific business scenario or problem is suitable for DT implementation.
- **`step_1_digital_twin_business_requirements_generator.md`** - Structured prompt template for extracting and defining comprehensive business requirements when implementing digital twin technologies. This generator helps identify key business objectives, operational constraints, data requirements, integration needs, and success metrics that will inform the subsequent team design and capability mapping phases.
- **`step_2_digitaltwin_capability_selector.md`** - Prompts for selecting appropriate digital twin capabilities
- **`Step_3_capability_deep_dives.md`** - Deep analysis prompts for capability exploration
- **`step_4_cpt_table_generator.md`** - Structured prompts for mapping business requirements to DT capabilities

## Usage Guidelines

### For Digital Twin Assessment
1. Begin with business requirements generation for combined systems
2. Use capability selector prompts to identify needed DT capabilities
3. Apply integration prompts to design cohesive DT+AI solutions

### Prompt Engineering Best Practices
- Customize prompts based on your specific industry and use case
- Iterate through prompt sequences systematically
- Document results for capability gap analysis
- Use prompts as templates for repeatable assessments

## Integration with Main Framework

TODO These prompts are designed to work with:
- **AI Agent CPT YAML** - Core capability definitions
- **Assessment Worksheets** - Structured evaluation tools
- **Framework Integration Guide** - DT+AI combination strategies

## Contributing

When developing new prompts:
- Follow the established format and structure
- Include clear instructions and expected outputs
- Test prompts with various use cases
- Provide examples where helpful
