# Part 1

```prompt
Instructions: Based on the capability analysis from the previous step, please provide a deeper examination of the most critical capabilities identified for this digital twin use case.

Capability Deep Dives

- For the most critical 3-5 capabilities identified in your previous analysis, provide a deeper analysis of:
    - Specific requirements for this use case
    - Success criteria for this capability
    - Recommended technology approaches
    - Potential challenges in implementation

Please use the results of your previous capability mapping and prioritization to determine which capabilities warrant this deeper analysis.

Please use Claude artifacts

# Part 2

```prompt
Instructions: Based on the capability analysis from the previous step, please provide a deeper examination of:

(1) the most critical capabilities identified for this digital twin use case, and 
(2) all Trustworthiness (TW) capabilities regardless of their priority level.

Capability Deep Dives

- For the most critical 3-5 capabilities identified in your previous analysis, plus ALL Trustworthiness (TW) capabilities, provide a deeper analysis of:
    - Specific requirements for this use case
    - Success criteria for this capability
    - Recommended technology approaches
    - Potential challenges in implementation

Please organize your response with the critical capabilities first, followed by a complete analysis of all Trustworthiness capabilities. For each capability, create a structured deep dive that addresses all four analysis points.

Please use the results of your previous capability mapping and prioritization to determine which non-Trustworthiness capabilities warrant deeper analysis, while ensuring all Trustworthiness capabilities receive detailed examination regardless of their priority level.

Please use Claude artifacts.
