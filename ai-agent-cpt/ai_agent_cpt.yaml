  description: >
    This YAML file contains a comprehensive catalogue of capabilities for AI Agent systems,
    organized into a streamlined 6-category 'periodic table' structure. It covers all aspects 
    of AI Agent technology including perception, cognition, learning, action, interaction, and 
    governance. Version 3.1 incorporates enhanced industrial and enterprise capabilities 
    identified through analysis of production MAGS systems like XMPro, addressing critical gaps 
    in consensus management, system integration, and distributed coordination.
  usage: >
    This file can be used for reference, planning, and implementation of AI Agent systems,
    capability assessment and anti-agent washing validation, architectural pattern selection,
    as well as for educational and research purposes in AI Agent technology and Multi-Agent 
    Generative Systems (MAGS).
