## Prompt 1: Business Context and Problem Definition

### AI-Powered Energy Management in Smart Grids

#### Business Domain
**Electric Utility Operations and Grid Management** - Specifically targeting electric utilities, grid operators, and energy service providers managing distributed energy resources within smart grid infrastructure.

#### Decision Problem
**Real-time Energy Distribution Optimization** - Grid operators need AI support to make continuous decisions about energy routing, load balancing, and renewable integration across increasingly complex, bidirectional power networks. The core challenge involves simultaneously optimizing three interconnected decisions:

- Where and how to distribute energy from multiple sources (traditional plants, solar, wind, storage)
- When to activate demand response programs or adjust pricing
- How to maintain grid stability while maximizing renewable energy utilization

#### Current Process
Currently, grid operators rely on manual analysis of historical data, basic forecasting models, and rule-based systems with limited real-time adaptability. Decisions are often reactive rather than predictive, leading to inefficient energy distribution and missed opportunities for renewable integration.

#### Key Metrics
- **Grid Stability**: Frequency regulation (±0.1 Hz), voltage control (±5%)
- **Economic Efficiency**: Cost per MWh delivered, peak demand reduction
- **Renewable Integration**: Percentage of renewable energy successfully integrated vs. curtailed
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Load forecasting error rates (target <5% MAPE)
- **Response Time**: Decision implementation within 15-minute intervals

#### Timeframe
**Multi-temporal Decision Making:**
- **Real-time (seconds)**: Grid stability responses
- **Short-term (15 minutes - 24 hours)**: Load forecasting and dispatch optimization
- **Medium-term (days - weeks)**: Maintenance scheduling and capacity planning

#### Data Sources
Smart meter readings, weather data, renewable generation forecasts, historical consumption patterns, grid sensor data, market pricing, and equipment status monitoring from distributed energy resources.

#### Constraints
- **Regulatory**: Compliance with NERC reliability standards and state utility regulations
- **Technical**: Legacy infrastructure interoperability, cybersecurity requirements
- **Economic**: Limited budget for infrastructure upgrades
- **Environmental**: Emission reduction mandates and renewable portfolio standards

#### Stakeholders
- **Primary**: Grid operators, utility engineers, energy traders
- **Secondary**: Residential/commercial customers, renewable energy producers
- **Regulatory**: Public utility commissions, environmental agencies
- **Technical**: IT/cybersecurity teams, equipment vendors

This AI system must balance multiple competing objectives while ensuring reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy delivery across diverse stakeholder needs.
