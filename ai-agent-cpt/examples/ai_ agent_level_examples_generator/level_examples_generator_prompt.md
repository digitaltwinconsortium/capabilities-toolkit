- **L4: Multi-Agent Generative Systems (MAGS)** (20-25 capabilities) - Collaborative intelligence with emergent behaviors

### Industry Focus Areas:
Use these realistic industry applications:
- Manufacturing & Industrial Operations
- Healthcare & Life Sciences  
- Energy & Utilities
- Architecture, Engineering, Construction & Operations

**Cognition & Reasoning (CG):** Planning & Decomposition, Reasoning, Decision Making, Problem Solving, Formal Planning, Plan Adaptation

**Learning & Adaptation (LA):** Memory Management, Reinforcement Learning, Self-Optimization, Supervised Learning, Vector Memory, Memory Scoring

**Action & Execution (AE):** Task Execution & Implementation, Tool Usage & API Integration, Code Generation & Execution, Content Creation & Generation, Tool Lifecycle Management, MCP Integration

**Interaction & Collaboration (IC):** Natural Language, Dialogue Management, Human-in-Loop, Agent Communication, Collaboration, Role Behavior, Consensus Protocols, Conflict Resolution, Industrial Integration, Enterprise Integration, Message Brokers, Distributed Coordination

**Governance & Safety (GS):** Deployment Management, Monitoring, Evaluation, Scaling, Safety, Security, Explainability, Reliability, Ethics, Privacy, Trust Management

## EXAMPLE STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:

For each maturity level (L1-L4), provide 3 examples following this exact structure:

### [Level] Example [Number]: [System Name]
**Industry**: [Specific Industry]
**Use Case**: [Specific operational use case]

**System Description**: 
[2-3 sentences describing what the system does, how it operates, and its primary value proposition]

**Capability Demonstration**:
- **Primary AIA CPT Capabilities**: 
  - [Capability ID] - [Capability Name]: [Specific example of how this capability is used]
  - [Continue for all capabilities used in this example]
  - [Ensure appropriate number of capabilities for the level]

**Technical Specifications**:
- [5-7 specific, measurable technical requirements and performance metrics]
- [Include integration details, response times, accuracy requirements, etc.]

**Real-World Implementation**:
- **Deployment Environment**: [Where the system operates]
- **Integration Points**: [What systems it connects with]
- **Human Interaction**: [How humans interact with or oversee the system]
- **Business Impact**: [Quantifiable business benefits]

**Level Progression Indicator**: 
[Explain why this represents the specific level and how it differs from lower/higher levels]

## SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:

### Capability Selection Guidelines:
- **L1**: Focus on IC.NL, IC.DM, PK.KB, basic GS capabilities (Security, Privacy, Explainability)
- **L2**: Add CG.PL, AE.TE, IC.CO, IC.RB, GS.MO, enterprise integration capabilities
- **L3**: Include CG.RE, CG.PR, LA.AF, LA.RL, advanced reasoning and learning capabilities
- **L4**: Require IC.CS, IC.CF, IC.DS, IC.AA, distributed coordination and consensus capabilities

### Governance & Safety Emphasis:
- Include appropriate GS capabilities in EVERY example (minimum 3-4 per level)
- Show progression from basic compliance to advanced trust management
- Demonstrate realistic safety and regulatory requirements for each industry

### Technical Realism:
- Use realistic performance metrics and technical specifications
- Include actual integration protocols and systems (SCADA, ERP, etc.)
- Specify measurable business outcomes
- Show appropriate human oversight and interaction patterns

### Industry Authenticity:
- Use real industry terminology and operational contexts
- Reference actual regulatory requirements and standards
- Include realistic operational challenges and constraints
- Show appropriate complexity for enterprise deployments

## OUTPUT FORMAT:

Structure your response with:
1. **Introduction** explaining the progression across levels
2. **L1 Examples** (3 examples, 8-10 capabilities each)
3. **L2 Examples** (3 examples, 10-15 capabilities each)  
4. **L3 Examples** (3 examples, 15-20 capabilities each)
5. **L4 Examples** (3 examples, 20-25 capabilities each)
6. **Summary** showing capability progression patterns

Generate comprehensive, realistic examples that demonstrate clear maturity progression while maintaining strong industry authenticity and technical credibility. Each example should be complete enough to use as a reference case study for that maturity level.
