## Instructions

Based on the detailed business requirements specification from the previous step, please identify and justify the specific capabilities from the Digital Twin Capabilities Periodic Table that would be required to support this digital twin use case.

## Analysis Tasks

### 1. Capability Mapping

For each of the six capability categories in the Digital Twin Capabilities Periodic Table, identify which specific capabilities would be required for this use case and present the results in a table:

#### Data Services (DS)

- List and explain required capabilities (e.g., DS.AI, DS.ST, DS.TR, etc.)
- Justify each selection based on the business requirements
- Note deployment considerations (edge, fog, cloud) for each capability

#### Integration (IR)

- List and explain required capabilities (e.g., IR.ET, IR.EG, IR.IO, etc.)
- Justify each selection based on the business requirements
- Identify key systems that would need integration

#### Intelligence (IC)

- List and explain required capabilities (e.g., IC.SR, IC.PR, IC.AI, etc.)
- Justify each selection based on the business requirements
- Highlight critical intelligence capabilities for business value

#### User Experience (UX)

- List and explain required capabilities (e.g., UX.BV, UX.AV, UX.RM, etc.)
- Justify each selection based on the business requirements
- Consider different user roles and their needs

#### Management (MG)

- List and explain required capabilities (e.g., MG.DM, MG.SM, MG.EL, etc.)
- Justify each selection based on the business requirements
- Consider operational governance needs

#### Trustworthiness (TW)

- List and explain required capabilities (e.g., TW.SC, TW.PR, TW.SF, etc.)
- Justify each selection based on the business requirements
- Highlight critical security or compliance considerations

### 2. Capability Priority Assessment

- Classify each identified capability as:
    - Essential (must have for minimum viable solution)
    - High Value (important for full business value)
    - Future Enhancement (beneficial for long-term evolution)

### 3. Digital Twin Capability Periodic Table Visualization

- Create a simple text-based table showing the selected capabilities from the Digital Twin Capabilities Periodic Table
- For each selected capability, indicate its priority level (Essential, High Value, or Future Enhancement) using the notation: [E], [H], or [F]
- Use a format like DS.AI [E] to indicate the capability ID and its priority level

### 4. Implementation Considerations

- Identify any capability gaps or challenges in implementing the required capabilities
- Recommend potential phasing approach for capability implementation
- Note any specialized expertise needed for specific capabilities

Your analysis should provide a clear roadmap of which Digital Twin Capabilities would be required to successfully implement the solution described in the business requirements.

Please use Claude artifacts.
