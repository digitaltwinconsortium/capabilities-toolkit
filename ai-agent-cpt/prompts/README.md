# AI Agent CPT Prompts and Sequences

This folder contains prompt engineering resources and sequence templates for the AI Agent Capabilities Periodic Table framework. These resources help users systematically approach capability assessment, team design, and implementation planning.

## Folder Contents

### AIA Sequence Prompts (`aia_sequence_prompts/`)
Specialized prompts for AI Agent CPT workflow and capability analysis:
- **`step_0_use_case_suitability.md`** - Initial assessment prompt for evaluating whether a specific business scenario or problem is suitable for AI agent implementation. This prompt guides users through analyzing factors like task complexity, data availability, automation potential, and ROI considerations to determine if AI agents are the right solution before proceeding with detailed capability mapping.
- **`step_1_digital_twin_business_requirements_generator.md`** - Structured prompt template for extracting and defining comprehensive business requirements when implementing digital twin technologies with AI agents. This generator helps identify key business objectives, operational constraints, data requirements, integration needs, and success metrics that will inform the subsequent team design and capability mapping phases.
- **`step_2_team_design_generation_prompt.md`** - Templates for designing AI agent teams and multi-agent systems
- **`step_3_aia_cpt_capability_mapping_prompt.md`** - Structured prompts for mapping business requirements to AI agent capabilities

## Usage Guidelines

### For AI Agent Assessment
1. Start with capability mapping prompts to understand your requirements
2. Use team design prompts to structure multi-agent approaches
3. Apply deep dive prompts for detailed capability analysis

### Prompt Engineering Best Practices
- Customize prompts based on your specific industry and use case
- Iterate through prompt sequences systematically
- Document results for capability gap analysis
- Use prompts as templates for repeatable assessments

## Integration with Main Framework

These prompts are designed to work with:
