# AI Agent CPT Prompts and Sequences

This folder contains prompt engineering resources and sequence templates for the AI Agent Capabilities Periodic Table framework. These resources help users systematically approach capability assessment, team design, and implementation planning.

## Folder Contents

### AIA Sequence Prompts (`aia_sequence_prompts/`)
Specialized prompts for AI Agent CPT workflow and capability analysis:
- **`aia_cpt_capability_mapping_prompt.md`** - Structured prompts for mapping business requirements to AI agent capabilities
- **`team_design_generation_prompt.md`** - Templates for designing AI agent teams and multi-agent systems

### Digital Twin Sequence Prompts (`digitaltwin_sequence_prompts/`)
Integration prompts for combining Digital Twin CPT with AI Agent CPT:
- **`capability_deep_dives.md`** - Deep analysis prompts for capability exploration
- **`digitaltwin_capability_selector.md`** - Prompts for selecting appropriate digital twin capabilities
- **`digitaltwin_business_requirements_generator.md`** - Business requirements generation for integrated DT+AI systems

## Usage Guidelines

### For AI Agent Assessment
1. Start with capability mapping prompts to understand your requirements
2. Use team design prompts to structure multi-agent approaches
3. Apply deep dive prompts for detailed capability analysis

### For Integrated DT+AI Systems
1. Begin with business requirements generation for combined systems
2. Use capability selector prompts to identify needed DT capabilities
3. Apply integration prompts to design cohesive DT+AI solutions

### Prompt Engineering Best Practices
- Customize prompts based on your specific industry and use case
- Iterate through prompt sequences systematically
- Document results for capability gap analysis
- Use prompts as templates for repeatable assessments

## Integration with Main Framework

These prompts are designed to work with:
- **AI Agent CPT YAML** - Core capability definitions
